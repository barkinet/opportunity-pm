[The Opportunity Project](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/03/07/fact-sheet-white-house-launches-opportunity-project-utilizing-open-data) is catalyzing the creation of new digital tools that use federal and local data to increase access to opportunity in communities around the country. By providing easy access to curated federal and local datasets at  [opportunity.census.gov](http://opportunity.census.gov), and by facilitating collaboration between technologists, subject matter experts, and local leaders, we are transforming government data into digital tools that meet needs like helping families to find affordable housing near jobs and transportation, connecting unemployed Americans with jobs that match their skills, and enabling local leaders to use data to better target investments.

We created this playbook as a guide for anyone who wants to use the Opportunity Project process to create more equitable communities. We hope that many people can benefit from this process, including federal agencies seeking new digital solutions for the public, teachers who want their students to learn how to use government data to solve local and national problems, local governments who want their data to be put to use to address the needs of residents, community groups looking to partner with tech talent to build capacity to advance their missions, and more.

This process is not one size fits all – it will look different depending on who you are and what big challenges you want to solve. The steps below reflect lessons we’ve learned through federally-led design sprints, and working with local governments, tech companies, experts, coding schools, and community leaders. You should adapt it to your needs, and share what worked for you.
