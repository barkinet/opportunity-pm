title: Team up
---

Collaboration is an essential part of The Opportunity Project process! You can team up with others before or after identifying a problem statement to be sure you have all the skills and perspectives you need to build a useful, high quality digital tool. Your goal is to recruit a team of people to work together, which might include technologists, government leaders, subject matter experts, and end-users, and think about other ways to add diversity to your team. 

### Checklist
1. Connect with a diverse set of partners in your community. Universities can be a great place to start since they are fill of people with a wide variety of skills and perspectives, including community and policy subject matter experts and technologists.
2. Make sure these partners represent a range of skills and expertise, in particular people who work on issues related to your challenge and ideally work closely with the target population or are in that target population themselves. 
3. Include people who are trained in user-centered design and user experience.
