title: Team up
---

You can team up with others before or after identifying a problem statement, but either way, collaboration is at the core of how the Opportunity Project works. Create a team of technologists, government (if applicable), subject matter experts, and end-users, and think about other ways to add diversity to your team. It’s always great to have user-centered design experts, user experience designers, and other forms of expertise that might be useful to you.

### Find potential collaborators through ...
- Slack 
- Sign up on our listserv, select how you’d like to get involved, and stay tuned. We will be in touch with opportunities to engage. 
- Go out and identify members of the ecosystem in your community. Universities often have most of the pieces in place already since there are people with a wide variety of skills and perspectives.
