Don’t stop there!  Get the word out and make sure people are using the tool you built.  

### Checklist
- Keep building and improving. 
-	Pro top for techies: Remember that agile delivery methods rely on iterative improvements. Technical team members should be ready and willing to maintain and improve whatever tool is in production, otherwise your early efforts may have been for naught!
-	Collect information on downloads and users, and think about measuring outcomes and how your tool is helping individuals and communities.  What impact are you having on the problem you set out to solve?  
-	Share information with the whole Opportunity Project community on Slack.
