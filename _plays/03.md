title: Co-create the vision

Next, work together to identify user needs and create a “use case” that outlines who you are targeting and how they might interact with a solution to address the challenge you selected. We value co-creation – working directly with target end users of the tool, so that you’re building with them, and not just for them. The problems you’re going to tackle, especially making communities more equitable, is complex, and no one person has all the answers. Working together with a diverse team, including people who are experiencing the problem directly, will help you to recognize your blind spots. 

### Checklist
1. Work with subject matter experts and end-users to understand the challenge and the gaps that you might help fill. Answer questions such as: How do people experience the problem? Do they have any tools to help them currently? What tools do they wish they had?  
2. Create a detailed use-case to guide your efforts.
