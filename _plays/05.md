title: Build iteratively and collaboratively
---

Once you identify a problem to tackle, the end users your tool will serve, and the data you will use, start building and sharing your experience with the Opportunity Project community! Work collaboratively to build a software product, including many voices and seeking feedback as much as possible throughout, especially from people who are the target end-users of what you’re building. You can use a sprint process to organize your time, like a semester, training program, or a software development sprint. For example, the Opportunity Project started with an eight-week software development sprint. Tech developers, experts, community leaders, people from federal and local government and others came together, chose problems to work on, and formed teams.  These groups talked regularly on Slack, and all came together in web hangouts every two weeks to demo their works in progress, ask questions, and share feedback. After eight weeks, they all launched their products together at the White House and continued to improve them and share them with the target end users. 

### Checklist
-	Before you start, think about how you will track success and the reach of your tool, such as tracking downloads or visitors, and learning more from users about how the product is influencing what they do and how. 
-	Identify the path for adoption once the tool is released – how will you connect end users with your product?  -	Engage target end users, advocates, and subject matter experts early and often in the design process. Collect feedback through user testing sessions or design demos.
-	If you’re interested in replicating the Opportunity Project sprint process and timeline, here’s what it looks like week-by-week: 
   0. Before kickoff: Identify a cohort of technologists, government representatives, subject matter experts, and community groups. Create a listserv and/or an online community where everyone can chat (for example: a Slack channel). 
   1. Week 1: Teams choose problem statements.
   2. Week 2: Teams dig into the data and start designing and building.
   3. Week 3: “Alpha” demo of the tools in-progress so teams can get early feedback from a diverse audience of end users, subject matter experts, government employees, and others.
   4. Week 4: Teams continue building while collaborating and getting more feedback along the way.
   5. Week 5: Do another demo! Teams share more advanced versions of the tools and get more feedback, particularly from end users of the tool. 
   6. Week 6: Teams keep building, doing interactive user testing sessions, and refining the tool. 
   7. Week 7:  Get ready to share the tools with the world. De-bug. Plan how to share the final products. 
   8. Week 8:  Everyone involved in the process joins together to launch the prototypes or final products.
   9. Week 9 and beyond: Continued improvement of the tools, getting the word out, sharing the product with the target end users, and measuring your impact. 
 
### Resources
-	Identify subject matter experts and other collaborators on Slack. 
-	Software developers can also use [Slack](https://opportunity-slack.herokuapp.com/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/uscensusbureau/opportunity) to share code, ask questions, post new suggested data sets, share feedback on data, and more.
