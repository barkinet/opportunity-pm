title: Collaborate and build iteratively
---

Once you have identified a problem you will tackle, the end users your tool will serve, and the data you will use, start building!  Before you start think about how you will track success and reach.  You may want to think about ways of tracking downloads or visitors, and learning more from users about how the product is influencing what they do and how. Also, think about the path for adoption â€“ how will you connect end users with your product?  Try to engage target end users or advocates early on in the design process!

### Checklist
- Collect feedback through user testing sessions or design demos. 
- Software developers can also provide feedback on the data in Slack or GitHub. 
- Continue to use resources to build and collaborate with others in the Opportunity Project community by joining the community in slack or in GitHub to share code, ask questions, post new suggested data sets, share feedback on data, and more.
