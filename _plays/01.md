title: Identify your priorities
---

We’re all about solving real-world challenges facing individuals and communities, like helping chronically unemployed Americans identify nearby jobs that match their skills, low-income families find affordable homes in close proximity to transportation and quality schools, and local leaders advocate for neighborhood resources. You can identify your areas of focus from a range of sources, and we encourage you to be concrete in scoping problems you want to solve. This usually involves connecting with agencies, departments, or community leaders who are mission-driven and close to challenges on the ground. 


### Possible problem statements
- A new dataset or combination of datasets. For example, the Department of Labor released an exciting new API, and tech teams built tools that, in addition to their direct impact on users, showed the art of the possible of what could be done with that data. 
- A priority articulated by a federal or local government, a community group, or directly by an end-user of the tool. 
- Otherwise, we provide detailed user-scenarios that can help you identify a challenge and how it affects people’s lives.
