title: Choose a Problem Statement
---

The Opportunity Project is about solving real-world problems facing individuals and communities. You can identify an issue to focus on from a range of sources, and we encourage you to be concrete in defining the problems you want to solve.


### Checklist

- To identify a meaningful challenge, you might want to connect with federal agencies, local leaders, community groups or other subject matter experts who are mission-driven and close to challenges on the ground. 
- Make sure to choose a challenge where a new digital tool that uses [federal and local data](http://opportunity.census.gov/build.html#datainventory) would be helpful. 
- Ask yourself whether it is realistic for you to develop something that could have a meaningful impact on this problem.
- Work directly with stakeholders and future users of your tool as early as you can! This is critical step in building a useful tool, but one that is easy to overlook. Don’t skip it!

### Resources
- [Challenges articulated by federal agencies](https://data.world/opportunity/problem-statements) to address national priorities. We want teams to continue identifying creative new approaches to address these challenges in communities around the country. 
-	Detailed [user-scenarios ](http://opportunity.census.gov/build.html#userscenarios)offered through the Opportunity Project that can help you identify real-world challenges that affect people’s lives.
-	The challenge can also come from a newly released dataset or [combination of datasets](http://opportunity.census.gov/build.html#datainventory) that help to understand and solve important problems. For example, the Department of Labor worked with the University of Chicago to release an exciting new API that combines skills data with labor market data. Tech teams collaborated with policy-makers to build tools that, in addition to their direct impact on users, showed what could be done with this data.
