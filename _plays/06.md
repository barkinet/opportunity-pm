title: Share your tool with the world
---

Make a splash when you release your tool! We’ve had success launching multiple tools at once, which draws more attention to the tools, the data, the approach, and all the collaborators who were involved.  This could be through a coordinated event in-person, online, or on social media.  After you’ve created a useful, user-centered digital tool, be sure to actually get it in the hands of your target end-users!  Hopefully you have been working closely with end-users and advocacy groups that represent them throughout the process, so those members of your team can help to adopt the tool and share it with others.  A marketing campaign, social media, or a launch event can also help to get the word out.  

### Checklist
- Consider whether to host an event to showcase your tools.
-	Use press and social media to spread the word! Use #OpportunityProject. 
-	Be sure to get it in the hands of end-users and their advocates so that your work can have the greatest possible impact on real world problems. 
- Share your code! Teams are highly encouraged to make all resulting software and tools open source and free for use by the public.
