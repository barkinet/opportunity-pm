title: Share your tool with the world
---

Make a splash when you release your tool! Weâ€™ve had success launching multiple tools at once, which draws more attention to the tools, the data, the approach, and all the collaborators who were involved. 

### Checklist
1. Consider whether to host an event to showcase your tools.
2. Be sure to get it in the hands of end-users and their advocates. 
3. Share your code! Teams are encouraged to make all resulting software and tools open source and free for use by the public.
