title: Find the data
---

We believe that by working together and combining different types of public data, we can build more equitable communities and expand access to opportunity. These public government data sets belong to all of us, and together we can use them to help solve many problems.  To help you use this information, we pulled together some of the best federal and local open data sets for information on local access to opportunity, things like proximity to jobs, transportation, affordable housing and quality schools.


### Checklist
- Start by checking out the Opportunity Project [data dictionary](http://opportunity.census.gov/build.html#datainventory). Browse the data, and download a metadata file with info on the year, format, and a brief, plain-language description of what’s in each data set.  
- Identify the most relevant federal and local data sets that can help to address your target end user’s needs, as identified in your use case(s).
- Pro tip for techies: Cut down on data discovery time by using existing tools, wrappers, and tutorials.  Check out the list provided in the resources list below.
Have questions or feedback about the data? Let us know on [GitHub](https://github.com/uscensusbureau/opportunity). 

### Data resources
- [Opportunity.census.gov](http://www.opportunity.census.gov/): This is the main way to access the curated Opportunity Project data and associated metadata.  You can find federal data, and local data from 12 cities (and counting!). Local data sets include helpful information on crime, local arts and culture, day care, free wifi hotspots, and more.  [Check out the inventory](http://opportunity.census.gov/build.html#datainventory) to find data for the entire country and to what is unique to your city, and download the metadata file for descriptions and more information on the data.
-	[Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/): Data.gov has over 200,000 data sets from federal government agencies.  If you need information that you are not finding on opportunity.census.gov, there are tons of other data sets to search here.  You can also ask the community on Slack or GitHub.

### Forums, tutorials, and other tools
- [data.world](https://data.world/opportunity?tab=datasets): Data.world hosts a compilation of data sets from the Opportunity Project and provides a space to share feedback on data and collaborate with others using the data.  This makes it easy for educators, data scientists, everyday citizens, and students, to discuss, analyze, query, visualize, and easily share their findings. You should go here if you want to share feedback or see what others have said about/done with the data.  You can also find exercises for students based on the Opportunity Project problem statements and datasets including this exercise on [Data Wrangling](https://data.world/nrippner/opportunity-project-use-case) and [Cluster Analysis](https://data.world/nrippner/cluster-analysis-challenge). 
- [CitySDK](https://uscensusbureau.github.io/citysdk/examples/arcGisHUD/): The Census Bureau created a series of tools that make it easier to combine and use government data. You can find an Opportunity Project module on the CitySDK website.
- [Commerce Data Usability Project](https://www.commerce.gov/datausability/): The Commerce Data Service has built a number of wrappers and [tutorials](http://blog.kaggle.com/category/tutorials/) that make Commerce datasets including our national weather data, Census data, patent data, and others, more easy to use.
-	[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/commerce-gov) is a community of 600K data scientists that has posted a number of USG datasets and also great tutorials for new data scientists. Stack Exchange has a [vibrant open data community](http://opendata.stackexchange.com/), which is a great place to come with questions and find early answers to your data- and developer-related questions.
