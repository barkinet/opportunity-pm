title: Find the data
---

Identify the most relevant federal and local data sets that can help to address your target end user’s needs.  Use the resources here to help you find and use data. The data sets are curated to help you find the most relevant and meaningful information, and understand how to use the data. 

### Data sources
-  [The Opportunity Project site](http://opportunity.census.gov):  This is the main way to access TOP data.  Start here, browse the data, and download a metadata file with info on the year, format, and a brief plain language description of what’s in each data set. Census also created a tool called CitySDK specifically to make it easier to combine and use government data. You can find a CitySDK Opportunity Project module on the site.
- [data.world](http://data.gov):  data.world hosts a compilation of data sets from the Opportunity Project and provides a space to share feedback on data and collaborate with others using the data.  You should go here if you want to share feedback or see what others have said about/done with the data. [how is this different from what we’re telling people to do in GitHub?]
- [data.gov](http://data.gov):  looking for something else?  Data.gov has over 200,000 data sets from federal government agencies.  If you need information that you are not finding on [opportunity.census.gov](http://opportunity.census.gov), there are tons of other data sets to search here.  You can also ask the community on Slack or GitHub.
